## Argon Case and Configuration

The Raspberry Pi 4 is housed in an Argon One case which provides active cooling if the temperatures reach above custom thresholds - the default thresholds are 55°C, 60°C and 65°C.
In order to install the scripts for the case run the following command:

```
curl https://download.argon40.com/argon1.sh | bash
```

The fan configuration can then be customised with 

```
argonone-config
```
